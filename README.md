# AnnoyingCalculator

A simple calculator right? wrong! This calculator will give you the right answer only when it feels like it.
Sometimes it is helpful, sometimes not.

Built with python tkinter, this project has a tree of different options it can take when you ask it to do a 
calculation. Sometimes it will give the correct answer, other times it will tell you its tired, or that the 
question was too easy, or it will give you a math problem to solve yourself. It's a fun game to see what it
will tell you. Invalid calculations have a whole set of responses as well. dialogue is stored in text files
so adding in new dialogue is easy.
